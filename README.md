# STM32-ILI9341

**Warning:** This library is currently untested, this readme will be updated once I've tested this with real hardware.

STM32 HAL-based library for ILI9341 TFT modules with touchscreen.

This library is a fork of [afiskon/stm32-ili9341][u0] which is based on [afiskon/stm32-st7735][u1] and
[afiskon/stm32-ssd1306][u2]. Initialization sequence for ILI9341 was borrowed
from [martnak/STM32-ILI9341][u3].

## Documentations

There's currently no documentation, the best way to know how to use this library is to read the source code. The documentation will come at a later time.
